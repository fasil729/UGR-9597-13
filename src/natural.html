              <h2>Dankil Depression and Lakes (Afar)</h2>
              <p>The Danakil Depression is the northern part of
                 <strong>the Afar Triangle or Afar Depression</strong>
                 in Ethiopia, a geological depression that has resulted
                 from the divergence of three tectonic plates in the Horn of Africa.</p>

              <p>What makes this three-day festival so unique is that it's the only time when the
                 Tabot - a replica of the Ark of the
                 Covenant containing
                 the Ten Commandments - is taken out from the churches across the country.</p>

              <p>The Danakil Depression is a plain approximately 200 by 50 km
                 (124 by 31 mi), lying in the north of the Afar Region of Ethiopia,
                  near the border with Eritrea. It is about 125 m (410 ft) below
                   sea level and is bordered to the west by the Ethiopian Plateau
                    and to the east by the Danakil Alps, beyond which is the Red Sea.
                    The area is often referred to as the cradle of humanity;
                     in 1974 Donald Johanson and his colleagues found the
                     famous Australopithecus afarensis fossil Lucy, which has
                      been dated 3.2 million years old[6] and many other fossils
                       of ancient hominins have been uncovered here, prompting
                        many palaeontologists to propose that this area is where
                         the human species first evolved.

                    <h2>Lake Tana</h2>
                    <p>is the largest lake in Ethiopia and the source of the Blue Nile.
                       Located in Amhara Region in the north-western Ethiopian Highlands,
                        the lake is approximately 84 kilometres (52 miles) long and 66
                         kilometres (41 miles) wide, with a maximum depth of 15 metres
                          (49 feet), and an elevation of 1,788 metres (5,866 feet)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Lake Tana is fed by the Gilgel Abay, Reb and Gumara rivers.
                       Its surface area ranges from 3,000 to 3,500 square kilometres
                        (1,200 to 1,400 square miles), depending on season and rainfall.
                         The lake level has been regulated since the construction of the
                          control weir where the lake discharges into the Blue Nile.
                           This controls the flow to <em>the Blue Nile Falls (Tis Abbai)</em>
                           and hydro-power station
                    </p>

                      <p>
                        In 2015, the Lake Tana region was nominated as a <b>UNESCO</b>
                         Biosphere Reserve recognizing its national and international
                          natural and cultural importance
                      </p>

                    <h2>Semien Mountains (Northern Ethiopia)</h2>
                    <p>The margins of this high plateau consist of precipitous cliffs and deep,
                         canyon-style gorges. In some places, the escarpment forms small
                          elevations that offer splendid natal lookout points. The spectacular
                           views from the observation points at Gidir Got and lmet Gogo in the
                            center of the Park offer unparalleled panoramas along the high plateau
                             and down to the lowland areas.</p>
                    <p>The main attraction of the Simien Moumains National Park is its
                         biosphere: the steep cliffs and the cool climate at the altitude
                          of the Erica tree line (3600 to 4000 m ash) have created
                          conditions that are appropriate for the survival of an ibex
                           species (Capra ibex wee) endemic to the Simien Mountains </p>
