              <h2>Meskel is soon!!! (27th Semptmber)</h2>
              <p>Meskel is one of the biggest religious festivals among Ethiopian Orthodox followers that commemorates
                a fourth century event where Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the Great, discovered the True Cross on
                which Christ was crucified. This festival is also registered with UNESCO as an element of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>

              <p>The centrepiece of this unique festival is the lighting of a
                massive conical bonfire called a Damera and all the dancing and feasting surrounding it.  The largest Meskel gathering takes place in Addis Ababaâ€™s
                Meskel Square, where hundreds of thousands of people, both locals and tourists, gather to watch the colourfully dressed priests chant, pray and dance.</p>

              <p>There are also equally magnificent celebrations across the country, including in Axum and Gondar. </p>

                    <h2>Enkutatash Ethiopian new year is soon!!!(11th Semptember)</h2>
                    <p>Ethiopia follows the Julian calendar with 12 months of 30 days each
                      and a 13th month of 5 days (6 in a leap year). It's for this reason that Ethiopia has
                      been nick-named 'the country with 13 months of sunshine'.</p>

                      <p>The Ethiopian New Year, which is eight years behind the Gregorian calendar,
                        falls on the date that the Queen of Sheba allegedly arrived back in Axum after visiting King Solomon in Jerusalem.</p>

                      <p>many places, children dressed in new clothes dance through the neighbourhood, distributing paintings (mainly of angles).
                       They will in turn be given bread or money in return for their New Year wish. During New Year's Eve, torches of dry wood are burned in front of
                        houses while the crowds sing and dance. Everyone will then jump the ash to mark the shift from the old year to the new one. </p>

              <h2>Timket(Epiphany) (19th Juanary)</h2>
              <p>This festival commemorates the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist in the river Jordan and is the most colourful festival of the year.</p>

              <p>What makes this three-day festival so unique is that it's the only time when the
                 Tabot - a replica of the Ark of the
                 Covenant containing
                 the Ten Commandments - is taken out from the churches across the country.</p>

              <p>The best place to be during Timkat experience is Gondar,
                 where the festivities culminate in a crowded and colourful afternoon
                  at the 17th century Fasilides' Bath, which is filled with water for the occasion.
                 Addis Ababa also provides a unique experience of Epiphany at Jan Meda. </p>

                    <h2>Ethiopians Chrstmas (Genna or Lidet) (7th Juanary)</h2>
                    <p>Genna (also called Liddet) is the Ethiopian equivalent of Christmas,
                       celebrated on the 7th of January every year. The actual Genna celebration is
                       preceded by a night long Vigil following 40 days of fasting where meat, egg
                       and dairy products are forbidden.</p>

                      <p>During Christmas Eve, there is a church service that runs through the
                         night until 9am. The end of the mass service then heralds the beginning
                         of the Genna celebration and the conclusion of the fasting period of
                          Advent locally known as Tsome Gehad.</p>

                      <p>Genna is mainly a family-oriented holiday and people in the countryside still
                         maintain the tradition of playing Yegenna Chewata, a hockey-like game,
                          following the prior evenings service. Yegenna Chewata, according to tradition,
                           is believed to have been played by the shepherds on the night Jesus was born.
                            If you are travelling during this time, Axum and Lalibela are among the best
                             places to be. </p>

                    <p>Fichee-Chambalaalla is a New Year festival celebrated among
                       the Sidama people. According to the oral tradition, Fichee
                       commemorates a Sidama woman who visited her parents and
                        relatives once a year after her marriage,bringig <em>buurisame</em>,
                        a meal prepared from false banana, milk and butter,
                         which was shared with neighbours.</p>
                    <p>  Fichee has since become a unifying symbol of the Sidama people.
                       Each year, astrologers determine the correct date for the festival,
                        which is then announced to the clans. Communal events take place
                         throughout the festival, including traditional songs and dances. </p>
