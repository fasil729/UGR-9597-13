                      <h2>Axum (axumite kingdom obelisks)</h2>
                      <p>Axum, or Aksum (pronounced: /ˈɑːkˈsuːm/), is a town in the
                         Tigray Region of Ethiopia with a population of 66,900 residents (as of 2015)</p>

                      <p>It is the site of the historic capital of the Aksumite Empire
                        a naval and trading power that ruled the whole region
                         from about 400 BCE into the 10th century. In 1980,
                          UNESCO added Axum's archaeological sites to its list
                           of World Heritage Sites due to their historic value.
                      </p>

                      <p>Axum is located in the Central Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base
                         of the Adwa mountains. It has an elevation of 2,131 metres (6,991 feet)
                          and is surrounded by La'ilay Maychew, a separately administered woreda
                           of the Tigray region.</p>

                      <h2>Lalibela rock hewn churches</h2>
                      <p><em>Lalibela (Amharic: ላሊበላ)</em> is a town in the
                         Amhara Region of Ethiopia. Located in the Lasta district and North
                          Wollo Zone, it is a tourist site for its famous rock-cut
                           monolithic churches. The whole of Lalibela is a large and
                            important site for the antiquity, medieval, and post-medieval
                            civilization of Ethiopia.[1] To Christians, Lalibela is one of
                             Ethiopia's holiest cities, and a center of pilgrimage.</p>

                      <p>The layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted,
                         especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic representation of Jerusalem.
                         This has led some experts to date the current church construction to the years
                          following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by the Muslim leader Saladin.</p>

                      <h2>Gonder palaces of ancient kings</h2>
                      <p>During unsettled periods between the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries,
                         Ethiopian rulers moved their royal camps frequently.
                      </p>
                      <p>King Fasil (Fasiledes) settled in Gondar and established it as a
                         permanent capital in 1636. After Fasil, successive kings continued building,
                          improving the techniques and architectural style.
                      <p> Before its decline in the late eighteenth century, the royal court had developed
                         from a camp into a fortified compound called Fasil Ghebbi,
                          consisting of six major building complexes surrounded by a wall
                           900 metres long. There are some twenty palaces and royal buildings
                            and thirty churches in the area</p>
